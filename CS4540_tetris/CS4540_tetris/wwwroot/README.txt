Keep in mind we do not expect someone to play themselves using multiplayer on AWS... This means if you are
trying to play multiplayer on one computer, have one site being ran in one browser and another in incognito because these are 
separate sessions. This way the game will not think you are in the same session and send the same info.

Also keep in mind that email confirmation will not work on sites that are deployed. This is because AWS does not allow spoofing.
Email confirmation will work on a local computer through the U's servers, but not on sites deployed using AWS because of these
spoofing limitations.
